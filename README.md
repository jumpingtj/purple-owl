## 🙌 Contributing

Found an issue or want to suggest improvements?
PRs are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/jumpingtj/purple-owl), but the theme uses similar colors for everything (e.g. all bgs are the same hue) so do keep that if you want to change anything.

It's under [MIT](https://github.com/jumpingtj/purple-owl/blob/master/LICENSE) - so feel free to use it! I'd love to see you experiment yourself (but do read MIT first - it's only two paragraphs).
